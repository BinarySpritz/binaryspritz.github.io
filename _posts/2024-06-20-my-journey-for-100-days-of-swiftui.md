In this blog post, I will log my journey in learning Swift and SwiftUI by following "[The 100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)".

There are two reasons for this diary to exist and be publicly available: first, to share my thoughts about the language and the framework, and second, as a review of the learning process proposed by "The 100 Days of Swift," which, as the title says, you have to follow for one hundred days. Moreover, as I am a person who already knows some programming languages, I was curious about how a new language is taught.

# Day 1
The day started with a brief introduction to the Swift programming language and how **variables**, **constants** and **literals** work in an assignment statement (the type inference concept is briefly introduced). 

In Swift, there are both variables and constants. The former can be reassigned to a new value, while the latter cannot be reassigned (although you can probably change values inside them when objects come into play).
{% highlight swift %}
var aVariable = 0
let aConstant = "String which cannot be reassigned"
{% endhighlight %}


Regarding literals, this first day is about strings, multi-line strings, integer, and doubles.

# Day 2
The following day, the course covered Boolean variables and string interpolation.

Regarding Boolean variables, the only novelty was the `.toggle()` method, which switches the value of the variable (similar to doing `myVar = !myVar`).

Regarding string interpolation (which is achieved through the \() pattern), the course stated that it is more efficient than concatenation using the + operation. For example, `"\(s1) \(s2) \(s3)"` is faster than `s1 + s2 + s3` because concatenation requires the use of a temporary variable for each “sum” except the last.

Finally, a simple exercise was assigned: a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter that required the knowledge acquired during the first two days.
{% highlight swift %}
let temperatureInCelsius = 29.0

print("Today's temperature is \(temperatureInCelsius)C or \(temperatureInCelsius*9/5)F")
{% endhighlight %}

# Day 3
During the third day, we started looking into more complex data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enumerations.

{% highlight swift %}
let anArray = ["Tim", "Craig", "Stever"]

let aDictionary = [
	"name": "Tim",
	"job": "CEO",
	"birthday": "November 1"
]

let aSet = Set(["Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear"]) // ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"] —> distinct items

enum WeekDays {
	case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday
}
var weekday = WeekDays.monday
weekday = .friday

{% endhighlight %}

Two interesting facts about these data structures are:
1. Sets are incredible faster than array when you are looking for an item inside (`.contains(…)`) but they are not ordered and cannot contains duplicates
2. When working with enums you don’t have to write every time `WeekDays` because the compiler is capable of understating it by the variable type.
